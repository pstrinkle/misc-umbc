<h3>CMSC 476/676<br>
Homework 3 - work individually<br>
Due: At the beginning of class, Thursday, March 12</h3>
</center>
<p>The objective of this assignment is to build an inverted file 
(index) for the 
documents in your collection. To execute your program, it should be 
sufficient 
to type: 
</p>
<menu>index input-directory output-directory </menu>
where the input-directory 
contains the original files (unprocessed) and the output-directory contains all 
generated output files (temporary files created along the way should be deleted 
to save space). 
The index command may be written in the language(s) of your choice.
<p><b>Terms and Term Weights</b> You should use the terms, and term
weights, generated by Homework 2. If you are not happy with your
Homework 2, you may use any classmate's Homework 2 as your starting
point. Mention this in your report.
</p><p><b>Output Files</b> The goal is to build a pair of files of <b>fixed length
records</b>. These files should be in ASCII for easier debugging. 
The dictionary records may be in 
either hash_order or alphabetic order.
The dictionary should contain three 
fields: 
</p><menu>the word<br>the number of documents that contain that word
  <br>the location of the first record in the postings file<br>
</menu>
The second, the 
postings file, should contain 
<menu>the document id<br>
the normalized weight of the word in the document<br></menu>
<p><b>Algorithm</b> You may implement either a memory based or sort
based or multi-way merge algorithm.  Measure the time the index function takes on
a varying number of documents (10, 20, 40, 80, etc.) and plot a graph of
the indexing time as a function of the number of documents in your report.
The timings should be done on the FULL indexing process (starting with the
raw documents).  </p>
<p><b>Program Testing</b> <br>
Use the same set of files as in Homeworks 1 and 2.</p>
<p><b>Program Documentation.</b> <br>
After your internal documentation 
(comments) are complete, write a report which provides an approximately 4 page
summary of your program. In particular, discuss how you 
extended/improved the preprocessing.  
Show two examples of input documents and 
the resulting (surviving) tokens.  Discuss how many tokens there were in the 
unprocessed files  
and how many there were (unique and total) in the final inverted file.  Discuss
the 
efficiency of your approach in terms of your timings 
on a linux machine (use the time command) as a function of 
number of documents indexed. The entire document should be
4 pages maximum. 
We will primarily be grading 
from the report, so make sure it clearly describes what you did and what your 
program's output and efficiency. 
</p><p><b>Hand In</b> <br>
Hardcopy of your code (including shell scripts), the 
report, and the first and last 200 lines of the dictionary and postings files.  I also encourage electronic submission, with the pdf file for your report, as well as other files attached as needed.  Send the email to Dr. Nicholas &lt;nicholas@umbc.edu&gt; AND Mr. Dimitroff &lt;dondim1@umbc.edu&gt;.
</p><p><b>Late Policy</b> <br>10% deduction per 24 hours. Assignments turned in 
during or after the class will result in a 10% deduction. </p></body></html>
