
Project 5 Design

Read in Dictionary and Postings files
Make document vectors for each document

Then make a centroid for each document vector
The centroid has the current vector and the sum vector and the length of the current vector

Each Centroid's Document Vector will be represented as a dictionary keyed on the term.

So compare two matrices you just grab the keys from one and dot product against the other.

This stuff needs to go into a table or a list...

Whenever two things are merged they are both pulled from the table and a new entry is made...
Then all comparisons against either of the two involved must be recalculated.
