Using TrinkleFTP is simple.  It utilizes port 3541 for all communication and data transfers.  The FTP Server will only handle one session at a time and after the session is complete the server exits, so this is a one-time quick server.  

To compile:
`make`
	Ignore the warnings, it works fine.
To run:
`./ftpserver`
`./ftpclient hostname`

Support for the following commands:
ls [dirname]
	Lists directory contents
cd dirname
	Changes Current Working Directory
get filename
	Where filename is in the server's path
put filename
	Where filename is in the client's path
pwd
	Prints Current Working Directory
quit
	Exits Program
