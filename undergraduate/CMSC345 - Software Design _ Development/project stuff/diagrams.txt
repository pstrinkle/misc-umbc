All,

Finished up the Use Cases.  Major changes came out of our friday meeting
regarding this, as it was the main focus of discussion.  Please review
this and know it for tommorow after class so we can make 'emergency'
changes if needed.

The breakdowns for the UML diagrams as as follows:

Heather - Print and Save (should be really easy)
Payal - Modify Plan Data
Emmanuel - Input Plan Data



Pat - View Plan Data

Kinda picked topics in the system.  I suppose just follow the path like
the user would, and thats what to diagram.  Just to keep everything
simple, send me things in as simple a form as you can.  No pdf documents,
because I cant edit them =/.  As soon as possible would be good, but I
know that I'm not able to do this merging all tonight due to scheduling
and 3 exams in the next 3 days.

Thanks guys, hope your week started well!
