; Simulation from a command file of a generic
; SET-RESET flip-flop.
;
; The objective of the simulation is to show the
; effect of asserting and deasserting the flip flop
; inputs and to see how the data changes ONLY
; on an appropriate clock edge
;
; initialize everything first
;
Reset
Set Asyn_Set 1 0
Set Asyn_Reset 0 0		; initialize FF to set Q to '0' (clear the flip-flop immediately)
Set FF_SET 0 0
Set FF_RESET 0 0
;
Set Asyn_Reset 1 20	; de-assert the asynchronous clear control
;
Set FF_SET 1 210		; set the FF to latch Q to a logic '1'
Set FF_SET 0 290		; the FF should continue to HOLD Q to '1'
;
Set FF_RESET 1 310	; set the FF to latch Q to a logic '0'
Set FF_RESET 0 335	; the FF should continue to HOLD Q to '0'
			; ....it does not, but why?
;
Set FF_RESET 1 410	; set the FF to latch Q to a logic '0'
