 HW8 More Pipelining 25 points

1) Note: If a data hazard is NOT prevented by data forwarding, then
   the pipeline stalls. 

   Assume data forwarding is working, does the following code stall?
   "stall" means it needs an extra  nop  instruction
   inserted, If the code stalls then list the instruction(s),
   labels of the instructions that get stalled (delayed due to extra  nop's).

      L1:  lw   $3, 50($3)  IF ID EX M  WB
      L2:  add  $2, $5, $4     IF ID EX M  WB
      L3:  sw   $2, 20($2)        IF ID EX M  WB
      L4:  lw   $5, 30($2)           IF ID EX M  WB
      L5:  lw   $6, 40($5)              IF ID -- EX M  WB
      L6:  add  $5, $5, $5                 IF ID EX M  WB
                      time  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 12

	L5 needs a nop, the rest line up because of data forwarding

2) How many total clock cycles will the following code use from
   start to completion in our MIPS architecture pipelined machine ?
   (We have full data forwarding and hazard prevention that
    automatically inserts  nop  as needed into the pipeline.)

        add  $5, $6, $7  IF ID EX M  WB
        lw   $6, 80($5)     IF ID EX M  WB
        sub  $7, $6, $5        IF ID -- EX M  WB
        and  $8, $7, $6           IF ID -- EX M  WB
        sw   $8, 84($8)              IF ID -- EX M  WB
                   time  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10

	Time: 10 Clocks
	
3) List all the inputs and outputs of the "forwarding unit" with
   their respective the number of bits. You may use the books signal
   name or any signal name that indicates what the input or output does.
   You may have to read the text as well as reading the diagram on 
   Page 416 in the textbook or from the lecture diagram.
   The eight signals are required.

   Inputs:
	1 forward 5 bits
	2 forward 6 bits
	A forward 5 bits
	A forward 5 bits
	B forward 6 bits
	B forward 6 bits
   Outputs:
	ID_RD
