Part 1

a)  How may  mul.d instructions in matmul2gcc.s ?
        1
b)  About how many  mul.d instructions in matmul2sgi.s ?
        66

Part 2

  The file hex.out has the source listing with line numbers,
  the hex address and hex instructions as loaded in memory and
  the disassembly with hex address and decoded instruction.

  An instruction field format is on page 207 of textbook.
  mul.d is the MIPS=SGI double precision floating point multiply, "R"
format.
  Watch out for where the register values are placed.
  (R2000 instructions differ from IRIX.GL.UMBC.EDU that are R??000.)

  Most of the instruction in the loop are "housekeeping", there are
various
  instructions for loading and storing data, l.d and s.d are just one
pair.

a) Do all the instructions have the same names in  matmul2sgi.s  and
hex.out ?
	No, there are some command names in hex.out I can't find in matmul2sgi.s

b) Find a  mul.d  instruction in hex.out [use this for c) and d) ]
   Write an assembly language line, write the machine address.
	mul.d	$f5,$f0,$f5
	0x10000c08

c) From the machine address, look up and write the  mul.d  instruction
   from  b)  as hexadecimal
	0x10000c08
	0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100 0000 1000

d) Write the hexadecimal as six decimal integers for the
   fields 6,5,5,5,5,6 bits
	4 0 0 1 16 8	




[main:19, 0x10000c08] 	mul.d	$f5,$f0,$f5

0x10000c08
10		00		0c		08
