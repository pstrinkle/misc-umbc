The following functions core dump:
split()
size()

split() follows verbatim Professor Peng's algorithm description and I still cannot get it to work properly.
size() written two different ways, essentially the same, neither of which seem to work and to no end.
I worked with Professor Frey on both functions and neither him nor I could find issues with the code in this project.

the following functions runs in an infinite loop printing the first element:
LevelOrderPrint():
   I tried it two different ways. The first method uses a queue "nodes" which gets pushed the t->element for the level printing, and then returns to the called function, it prints the parents, and dequeues then enqueues the children as was advised in class. Then I chnaged the function to just directly print as it follows recursion. 

I am without ideas on where to go and time has run out. I cannot answer the questions related to the project because I couldn't get the thing to work, so I couldn't speculate experimental data. 

Thanks,
