CMSC 341 -- Spring 2005 -- Project 3 Questions

Copy this file into your directory and edit it to add your answers
to the following questions about Project 3.

These questions count for 10% of your project grade.


1. (5 points) Consider 15 keys 1, 2, ..., 15.
   1) Give an insertion sequence of these 15 key that generates the tallest 
      possible BST.      
   2) Give an insertion sequence of these 15 key that generates the shortest 
      possible BST.
   3) Generate s random insertion sequence of these 15 key (using any random 
      function).
   4) Run your program on these three sequences, compare the height of 
      randomized BST  with the corresponding ordinary BST. Indicate whether 
      your results are consistent with the theoretical results.
   [NOTE: Please do not cut and paste all running results in the answer. 
    Only list the  three sequences and the height comparisons.]

2. (5 points) The function for splitting a BST given in the project 
   description is a tail recursive function. Write in pseudo code an iterative 
   version of  this function.
