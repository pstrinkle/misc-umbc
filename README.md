# misc-umbc

I was a student at UMBC from 2003 to 2013, more or less.  I attended for both my 
BS in Computer Science and then as a PhD student who dropped out to move to California (earning my Masters in the process).

I've included various source materials from my coursework here as a personal reference in case I find it useful.  I doubt anyone else will.
